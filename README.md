# An experimental approach to estimate marine heatwave thresholds and baselines for ecological risks
Scripts and data for our experiments and analyses are in the main folder. The "Beaty et al. 2023 data and analysis" folder contains some data from Beaty et al. (2023) and the script that we used to test whether a fixed experimental temperature threshold (as used in Beaty et al. (2023)) reasonably reflects the thermal threshold of ectotherms, by investigating how the CTmax and the thermal safety margin change with time (more details in the main paper).
